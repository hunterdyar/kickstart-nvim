# nvim
See forked kickstart repo for instructions, etc.

### UI
*in lua/ui.lua*
- add colorthemes for (':Telescope colorschemes')
- sets default colorscheme
- nvim-tree for explorere
- vim-transparent to deal with that for me, although it feels like overkill
- chentoast/marks.vim for showing the jump gutter marks (' then indicated mark)
- cheetsheet plugin for telescope. Seems neat but idk, might disable it.

### Main
*in init.lua*
- add 'space+e' for tree keymap
- require ui
